## Data

The project uses a dataset containing various features related to mental health. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development.

## Model

We employ machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees to predict mental health conditions. The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated for accuracy and performance.

## Web Application

The Flask web application provides an intuitive interface for users to input their information securely. It integrates the trained machine learning model to generate real-time predictions and insights.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms
- Enhance the user interface with additional visualizations
- Develop a mobile application version
- Integrate with wearable devices for real-time data collection
